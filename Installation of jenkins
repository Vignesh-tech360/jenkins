Step 1: Update and upgrade your system by running

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Now import GPG keys to your system

     curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
     /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
     
Step 3: Add the Jenkins repository to the sources list once the GPG key has been imported.

     echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
     https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
     
Step 4: Once again update your system.

    sudo apt update
    
Step 5: Finally, install Jenkins by running the following command. 

    sudo apt install jenkins
    
Step 6: Now, start the Jenkins server by using systemctl command.

    sudo systemctl start jenkins

    sudo systemctl status jenkins
    
Step 7: Now enable the system firewall and open port 8080 to access the Jenkins server.

    sudo ufw enable
      if you get error(ie "ufw command not found") then, run
        sudo apt-get install ufw

    sudo ufw allow 8080
    
Step 8: Verify the changes by running

    sudo ufw status
    
Step 9: Start configuring Jenkins by navigating to http://localhost:8080.
        Unlock the admin privileges by entering the default password created during the installation. 
        get password by entering
            sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
            
Step 10: Create a new account by entering a username, password, and email address.

Step 11: Select Install suggested plugins and wait till all the plugins are successfully downloaded and installed on your machine.

Step 12: At this point, Jenkins has been successfully installed and configured on your Debian machine.
