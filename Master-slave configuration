Prerequisite:
    Java version 8 or above shoud be installed both master and slave.
    
Master:
    Step 1: click create node 
    step 2: configure node:
            Name: enter the name for your agent
            Desc: add desc of your node
            no of executor: This tell's how many job a agent can run paralel
            Now fill the fields:
              Remote root directory; (e.g.: /home/jenkins )
              label; (e.g.: agent1 )
              usage; (e.g.: only build jobs with label expression…​)
              Launch method; (e.g.: Launch agents by SSH )
              Host; (e.g.: localhost or your IP address )
              Credentials; (e.g.: jenkins )
              Host Key verification Strategy; (e.g.: Manually trusted key verification …​ )
   step 3: Press the Save button and the agent1 will be registered, but offline for the time being. Click on it.
   step 4: You should now see This node is being launched.. If that’s not the case, you can now press the Relaunch agent button and wait a few seconds. 
           You can now click on the Log button on the left, then you should receive the message: Agent successfully connected and online on the last log line.
   
   
   
   
Slave:
    Step 1: Setup ssh connection in slave machine.
            ssh start
    step 2: Create user in slave machine 
            sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/jenkins -m username
            su passwd userame
              this command is used to set the password for the new user

    step 3: Switch to the new user.
            su username
    step 4: Create ssh key
            If ssh is not enabled or not installed,then
                 sudo apt-get install openssh-server
                 sudo systemctl enable ssh
                 sudo systemctl start ssh
            ssh-keygen
              this command create a ssh key.
            sudo ls /~/.ssh/ (or) sudo ls /root/.ssh 
              This command show the generated keys
                id_rsa- is a private key , id_rsa.pub - is a public key
    step 5: making the created shh key as a valid one.
            cd ~/.ssh/
            cat id_rsa.pub
              Add this key as a authoried key
              so, 
                cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
